# 100 Days of Code - Day 85

## Topics Covered
### 1. **Installing Next.js**
- Installed Next.js via the command line using `npx create-next-app@latest` to quickly set up the environment.
- Reviewed the project structure and key files such as `pages`, `public`, and `styles`.
- Learned how Next.js optimizes for both client-side and server-side rendering by default.

For more details, refer to the official Next.js documentation on [Installation](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations/installation).

### 2. **Server and Client Components**
- Explored the difference between **Server Components** (used for rendering server-side) and **Client Components** (used for client-side interactivity).
- Discussed how Server Components help reduce JavaScript sent to the client and improve performance, while Client Components handle user interactions.
