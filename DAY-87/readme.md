Today, I focused on taking my Next.js app to the next level by mastering:

- **ðŸŽ¨ CSS Styling**: Crafted responsive, visually appealing layouts with clean, reusable CSS strategies.
- **âš¡ Font & Image Optimization**: Boosted app performance using `next/font` for fonts and `next/image` for images, ensuring faster load times and improved user experience.
