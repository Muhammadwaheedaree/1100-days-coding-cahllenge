# 100 Days of Code - Day 81: React.js & Next.js Foundations ðŸš€

## ðŸ“– Overview
Welcome to **Day 81** of my **100 Days of Code** journey! Today, Iâ€™ve embarked on mastering **React.js** and **Next.js**â€”two crucial technologies in modern web development. Below is a concise summary of the key topics covered:

---

## ðŸŸ¦ React Foundations
Starting with the **React** basics, I explored how this JavaScript library helps create interactive and dynamic UIs. This foundation is essential for transitioning into **Next.js** and full-stack web development.
