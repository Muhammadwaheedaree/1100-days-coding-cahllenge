# Day 84 - 100 Days of Code: Adding Interactivity with State and Props in React

## Overview
On Day 84 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, I focused on two core React concepts: **Adding Interactivity with State** and **Displaying Data with Props**. These skills are fundamental for creating dynamic, responsive user interfaces in React.

### Key Concepts Explored:
- **Event Handling in React**: I learned how to listen for user interactions, such as clicks, and trigger actions using Reactâ€™s `onClick` event handler.
- **State Management with Hooks**: I worked with the `useState()` hook to manage and update state within a component, enabling real-time changes in the UI based on user actions.
- **Props in React**: I explored how to pass data to child components via props, allowing for more dynamic and reusable component structures.

### Key Takeaways:
- **State**: Understanding how to initialize, store, and update state using hooks in React.
- **Interactivity**: Leveraging event handlers to respond to user inputs and provide real-time feedback.
- **Props**: Using props to pass data between components, enhancing the reusability and scalability of the application.

## Next Steps:
Moving forward, I aim to explore more advanced concepts in React, including managing more complex states and integrating React with Next.js to develop larger, more scalable applications.
