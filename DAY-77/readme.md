# Day 77: SSL vs TLS vs SSH

Today, I explored the differences between SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), TLS (Transport Layer Security), and SSH (Secure Shell). These protocols play crucial roles in securing communication over the internet and networks. Here's a brief overview:

## SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
SSL was the predecessor to TLS and was designed to secure communication between a client and a server. It provides encryption, data integrity, and authentication.

## TLS (Transport Layer Security)
TLS is the successor to SSL and serves the same purpose but with improved security and performance enhancements. It encrypts data during transmission to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.

## SSH (Secure Shell)
SSH is a network protocol that provides a secure way to access and manage remote devices over an unsecured network. It ensures data integrity and confidentiality through encryption.

Understanding these protocols is essential for developing and maintaining secure applications and networks.
