1. **Pushed the Project Online**  
   - Connected my Next.js project with Vercel for instant previews and deployments.  

2. **Created and Linked a PostgreSQL Database**  
   - Set up a database through Vercel and securely linked it using `.env` files.  

3. **Seeded the Database**  
   - Populated the database with sample data for development and testing.  

4. **Ran and Verified Queries**  
   - Used SQL to test the database and confirm everything worked perfectly.  

### âš¡ Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Next.js**
